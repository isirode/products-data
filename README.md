# Products data

This is the repository containing the data for the Java application [products-data](https://github.com/isirode/products-app), allowing to query the products using their properties.

The website (work in progress) is available here : https://web.products.onesime-deleham.ovh/

## Editing files

I am using VSCode with the extension [Better Stronger TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Isirode.better-stronger-toml) for schema validation and auto-completion.
